# Classifying-miRNA-ML

This is an attempt to classifying miRNA sequences from different species.

**update1** - Working with Homo sapiens and Mus musculus sequences

- Through featurization, I have extracted 
  - different kmers counts (1, 2, 3, 4) 
  - GC Content
  - zCurve 
- EDA conclusion:
  - Data is highly overlapping
